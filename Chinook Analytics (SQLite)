-- # For this project, I downloaded a dataset called chinook, which represents a digital media store and includes tables for artists, albums, media tracks, invoices, and customers

SELECT * FROM chinook.customers;

--1. Show Customers (their full names, customer ID, and country) who are not in the US

SELECT FirstName, LastName, CustomerId, Country FROM chinook.customers
WHERE country != "USA"
ORDER BY Country;


--2. Show only the Customers from Brazil

SELECT FirstName, LastName, CustomerId, Country FROM chinook.customers
WHERE Country = "Brazil";


--3. Find the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil. The resulting table should show the customer's full name, Invoice ID, Date of the invoice, and billing country.

SELECT FirstName, LastName, InvoiceId, InvoiceDate, BillingCountry FROM chinook.customers cus
LEFT JOIN chinook.invoices inv
ON inv.CustomerId = cus.CustomerID
WHERE cus.Country = "Brazil";


--4. Show the Employees who are Sales Support Agents

SELECT FirstName, LastName, Title FROM chinook.employees
WHERE Title = "Sales Support Agent";


--5. Find a unique/distinct list of billing countries from the Invoice table

SELECT DISTINCT BillingCountry FROM chinook.invoices;


--6. Provide a query that shows the invoices associated with each sales agent. The resulting table should include the Sales Agent's full name

SELECT emp.LastName, emp.Firstname, inv.InvoiceId FROM chinook.Employees emp 
JOIN chinook.Customers cust 
ON cust.SupportRepId = emp.EmployeeId
JOIN chinook.Invoices inv 
ON inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId;


--7. Show the Invoice Total, Customer name, Country, and Sales Agent name for all invoices and customers

SELECT inv.total, cust.FirstName as "Customer", cust.LastName, cust.Country, emp.FirstName as "Sales Rep", emp.LastName FROM chinook.customers cust
JOIN chinook.invoices inv
ON cust.CustomerId = inv.CustomerId
JOIN chinook.employees emp
ON cust.SupportRepId = emp.EmployeeId;


--8. How many Invoices were there in 2009?

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM chinook.invoices inv
WHERE inv.InvoiceDate LIKE "%2009%";


--9. What are the total sales for 2009?

SELECT SUM(Total) FROM chinook.invoices
WHERE invoices.InvoiceDate LIKE "%2009%";


--10. What's the average amount of tracks used in playlists?

SELECT AVG(T_COUNT) FROM
(SELECT COUNT(TrackId) as T_Count FROM chinook.playlist_track
GROUP BY PlaylistId);


--11. Write a query that includes the purchased track name with each invoice line ID

SELECT t.Name, i.InvoiceLineId FROM chinook.invoice_items i
JOIN chinook.tracks t
ON t.TrackId = i.TrackId;


--12. Write a query that includes the purchased track name and artist name with each invoice line ID

SELECT i.InvoiceLineId, t.Name as Track, ar.Name as Artist FROM chinook.invoice_items i
LEFT JOIN tracks t
ON i.TrackId = t.TrackId
INNER JOIN albums al
ON al.AlbumId = t.AlbumId
LEFT JOIN artists ar
ON ar.ArtistId = al.ArtistId;


--13. Provide a query that shows all the Tracks, and include the Album name, Media type, and Genre

SELECT t.Name, a.Title, m.Name, g.Name FROM chinook.tracks t
JOIN chinook.albums a
ON a.AlbumId = t.AlbumId
JOIN chinook.genres g
ON g.GenreId = t.GenreId
JOIN chinook.media_types m
ON m.MediaTypeId = t.MediaTypeId;  


--14. Show the total sales made by each sales agent

SELECT e.FirstName, e.LastName, ROUND(SUM(i.total), 2) as "Total Sales" FROM chinook.employees e
JOIN chinook.customers c
ON e.EmployeeId = c.SupportRepId
JOIN chinook.invoices i
ON c.CustomerId = i.CustomerId
WHERE e.Title = "Sales Support Agent"
GROUP BY e.FirstName;


--15. Which sales agent made the most dollars in sales in 2009?

SELECT e.FirstName, e.LastName, ROUND(SUM(i.total), 2) as "Total Sales" FROM chinook.employees e
JOIN chinook.customers c
ON e.EmployeeId = c.SupportRepId
JOIN chinook.invoices i
ON c.CustomerId = i.CustomerId
WHERE e.Title = "Sales Support Agent"
AND i.InvoiceDate LIKE "%2009%"
GROUP BY e.FirstName
ORDER BY "Total Sales" desc
LIMIT 1;
